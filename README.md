# NYTimes's Letter Boxed Solver

Solve this really addicting game with this application!

In the middle of making this, I found out that someone had already beat me to the punch with their solution which uses a graph in tandem with a Trie versus mine which uses a Trie and some cheeky recursive backtracking. While my solution does give a decent answer, their solution is definitely a lot more elegant. 

Check the original implementation here, which uses a directed graph to help:
